Objective: Develop a machine learning model to accurately classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham).
Data: Utilize a labeled dataset containing examples of spam and non-spam emails.
Model: Employ a classification algorithm, such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines, to train the model on features extracted from email content.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Implement the trained model into an email system to automatically filter and flag potential spam messages.
